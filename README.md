# archlinuxarm-rpi-autoinstall
Script to auto install ArchlinuxArm for Raspberry pi
It's just a stupid script based on the instructions in the[archlinuxarm wiki](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv6/raspberry-pi)

Todo list:
- Add comments
- Check if the script run as root
- Check if required tools (wget, fdisk, etc...) are already installed
