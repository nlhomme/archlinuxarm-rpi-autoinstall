# archlinuxarm-rpi-autoinstall
Script to auto install ArchlinuxArm for Raspberry pi.
It's just a stupid script based on the installation instructions given in the [archlinuxarm wiki](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv6/raspberry-pi)

Todo list:
- Add comments in the script
- Check if the script run as root
- Check if required tools (wget, fdisk, etc...) are already installed
